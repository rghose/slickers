A multiplayer treasure hunt game where multiple users can connect and play a game of treasure hunt.

Points are awarded for each player.

The software consists of a server and a client. The server sets the game parameters, i.e., the grid size and number of randomly placed treasure spots.

The server then waits for players to connect within a specified amount of time after which the game starts.

The game is over after all the treasure spots in the grid are grabbed by the players. A treasure is grabbed by an user who moves into that spot in the grid. Movement is via arrow keys. Each individual player is assigned a player number which is shown on the grid when the game is being played.

An idle player would be booted (or removed) from the game.

The server restarts with the same parameters after a game is finished.
